# Animal Crossing: New Horizons Bells Calculator

Live app: https://acnh-bells-calculator.vercel.app/

## Summary

This is a quick calculator app I created that simply adds Bells totals for items found in the game. I designed it because I wanted to know how much items were worth while collecting in the game to sell to complete in-game projects, like building new inclines and bridges.

It's extremely bare bones: You just select a category — including Fish, Sea Creatures, Fossils, and Bugs — and add them to your Pockets. Once you have all items you've collected in teh game, you click calculate to get your Bells total.

## Technologies

For this app, I used:

- React.js
- ACNH API (http://acnhapi.com/)

Again, it's super simple, and has no BE besides the ACNH API used to retrieve in-game items and their prices.
